Why doesn't the .NET implementation of Web Services support GZIP compression? I've found a couple of [articles](http://www.dotnetjunkies.com/Tutorial/ShowContent.aspx?cg=90D3B3E0-6544-4594-B3BA-E41D8F381324&amp;forumID=4078)describing how to implement it, but I'll have to do a bit of digging (my Reference.cs doesn't have the mentioned methods...).

I'd have thought that Web Services were about the single most obvious place to support compression...grr...anyway, I'll post any progress I have...
UPDATE:  Man, I should read these articles properly...it's an override...the method isn't in Reference.cs - look, I have a cold, be kind! So, I'll just write a little proxy class which the Reference.cs can inherit from instead to support compression using the excellent [SharpZipLib](http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SharpZipLib/Default.aspx) to provide the compression services...I'll of course make my new proxy class available here...
